# CV-Mindcare ML Requirements for Raspberry Pi 5 (ARM64)
# Optimized dependencies for ARM64 architecture with reduced memory footprint
#
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-ml-rpi.txt
#
# Note: These are lighter alternatives to full ML stack for embedded deployment

# Camera - Native Raspberry Pi support (much faster than OpenCV)
picamera2>=0.3.12
# Note: picamera2 is pre-installed on Raspberry Pi OS, but include for venv

# Audio Processing
# sounddevice  # Alternative: Use ALSA directly for lower overhead
pyaudio>=0.2.13  # Better ARM64 support than sounddevice

# Computer Vision (lightweight)
opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0  # Headless version (no GUI, smaller)
# Note: Use 'opencv-python-headless' instead of full 'opencv-python'

# Lightweight ML Inference
# Option 1: TensorFlow Lite (Recommended for Raspberry Pi)
tflite-runtime>=2.14.0  # Much smaller than full TensorFlow (~5MB vs ~500MB)

# Option 2: ONNX Runtime (Alternative lightweight inference)
# onnxruntime>=1.16.0

# Face Detection - Lightweight models
# Instead of DeepFace (too heavy), use lightweight alternatives:
mediapipe>=0.10.8  # Google's lightweight ML framework (includes face detection)

# Emotion Detection - Lightweight
# fer>=22.4.0  # Lightweight emotion recognition library

# Image Processing
Pillow>=10.0.0

# Numerical Operations (already in requirements-base.txt, but ensure ARM64 wheels)
# numpy
# scipy

# Note: Avoid heavy dependencies on Raspberry Pi:
# ❌ torch (PyTorch) - Too large (~1.5GB), use TFLite instead
# ❌ transformers - Too memory intensive for Pi
# ❌ deepface - Requires tensorflow/pytorch backend
# ❌ accelerate, safetensors - PyTorch ecosystem

# Development/Testing (optional)
# pytest>=7.4.0
# pytest-cov>=4.1.0
